Why are Array used?

Array help maintain large sets of data under a single variable name to avoid 
confusion that can occur when using several variables

Java Array
    * an object which contain elements of a similar data type.
    * Contiguous memory location 
    * a data structure where we can store similar elements
    * Store only a fixed element in a java array
    * Index based

Advantages
    * Code Optimization
        it makes the code more optimized,
        where we can retrieve or store the data efficiently

    * Random Access
        we can get any data located at an index position

Types of Array

    * Single Dimension Array
    * Multi Dimension Array
