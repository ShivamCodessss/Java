Functions

You can think of a function as an input output machine
The machine takes the raw material as in input and work with them to produce    
a product (output)

A Function accepts values, process them and then performs an action, return a 
new value or both

Function can save us from having to write same code again.

A function can be called again and again to perform the repeated tasks

STATIC FUNCTION IN JAVA
    *The static keyword can be used with variable, constant and fucntions
    * The main purpose of using the static keyword is to manage the memory so that
        we can use the memory efficiently 
    * if the keyword is prefixed before the function name, the function is called as 
        static function 
        it is often called a method

        
    PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN(STRING[] ARGS)
    PUBLIC = Access specifier 
    Static  = Static keyword
    void = return type 
    main = method name 
    String = array
